*Monitoring and Evaluation | Public Policy & Research | DMEO, NITI Aayog

I work in the public policy domain and analyze government schemes to support evidence-based policymaking. My focus is on research, monitoring, and evaluation of policies and programs.
Currently, I am a Young Professional at the Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO), NITI Aayog, where I evaluate Urban Development and Skill Development schemes for the Sixteenth Finance Commission (2026–2030). I design indicators to track outputs and outcomes, assess implementation of flagship schemes, and support ministries in strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems.

I hold an academic background in economics, with an interest in linking research with impact assessment, evaluation and governance.
